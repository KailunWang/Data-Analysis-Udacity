## Project 1: Exploring US Bikeshare Data (`1.Bike_Sharing/`) 
### Overview 
Performed an exploratory analysis on data provided by Motivate, a bike-share system provider for many major cities in the United States. Compared the system usage between three large cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC. Discovered differences within each system for those users that are registered, regular users and those users that are short-term, casual users.
